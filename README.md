![ESP32 NTP RTC](path_to_startup_animation.gif)

This repository contains code for creating a real-time clock (RTC) using ESP32 microcontroller and Network Time Protocol (NTP) via WiFi client. The RTC fetches accurate time from NTP servers over the internet, ensuring precise timekeeping for various applications.

## Features

- ESP32 microcontroller-based real-time clock.
- Utilizes WiFi client to connect to NTP servers for accurate time synchronization.
- Startup animation to indicate successful initialization.

## Setup

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect your ESP32 board to your computer using appropriate connections.
2. **Software Setup**:
    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    - Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
    - Upload the code to your ESP32 board.
3. **Configuration**:
    - Adjust WiFi credentials and NTP server settings in the code if necessary.
4. **Upload and Run**:
    - Upload the code to your ESP32 board.
5. **View Output**:
    - Monitor the serial output to view time updates and any additional information.
    - Observe the startup animation indicating successful initialization.
